About (Short Description / Summary):
An application where users can find technology experts in their respective immediate vicinity. 
Sometimes it so happens that we are working on some project in some specific technology and might often need immediate help in that domain. 
The help is best utilized if obtained from a nearby source, where hands-on guidance is possible. 
To solve this problem, a user can register in our app once, set his/her locality and choose his/her expertise.
 Once chosen, the data is stored in a database (externally). Similarly, when a set of people are registered in the system and a user is looking for 
some expertise in some area (eg. PHP developer in Model Colony area, Pune), the application will give him/her the list of experts
 (along with their contact details which they had shared while registering in the system) from that area arranged in descending order of distance
 from that specific user.

Install (Installation procedure): The application will be installed on the device once the user selects the apk file and clicks on Install.

Usage:-

Start the application and register yourself as a user.

The php files have to be saved on a server.

The code in the Android source files contains the IP address of the server (library/UserFunctions.java) . Set the IP address in the code to the IP address of your server. All
 the devices that are connected to the server can use the app to find experts in their areas of interest.
